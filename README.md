# revolut is an application that converts between sums of currencies.
It gets json from 2 servers and images from other server, converts json to data classes and inflate it into recyclerview. the first line is the base currency, by which the other lines are converted. 
to change to other base currency one needs to click on the prefered currency line. and then to change the sum written near it (after the line becoming the first line in the list).
